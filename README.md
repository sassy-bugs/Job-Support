## How to add data to dataset

### Add intent examples to `data/nlu.yml`
```yml
- intent: new_intent_name
  examples: |
    - some intent examples
    - make sure the examples help train the AI
    - and has all necessary keywords as well as variations of the keywords
    - minimum 5 examples are recommended
    - these examples all correspond to the same intent and will be mapped to a particular response so kindly do not club various examples together.
```
### Add intent name and response to `domain.yml`
```yml
intents:
  - existing_intent_name
  - new_intent_name
  .
  .
  .
responses:
  utter_new_intent_name:
  - text: "The response to new_intent_name"
  - image: "https://image.com/image.png" # optional
```

### Add rules to `data/rules.yml` to map the intent and response
```yml
- rule: Do action when asked about intent
  steps:
  - intent: new_intent_name
    action: utter_new_intent_name
  ```
